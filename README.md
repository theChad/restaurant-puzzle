# restaurant-puzzle

This project is meant to solve a little word scramble puzzle. The puzzle gives a list of words, which should be reordered such that they sound like some other coherent collection of words. For example, "TAB ESS MEANT LISH" might be rearranged to sound like "ESTABLISHMENT." Due to the strict adherence to the phoneme dictionary, however..the program won't currently make that link.

## Usage

Only looks at one line of clue words. Reads in a phoneme dictionary and the first line of the clue file, and write the answers to a file. Prunes down to answers with at least `b` of the base words (or their homophones) missing. 

Run with `lein run -- `, followed by options.
