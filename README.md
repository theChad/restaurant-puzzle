# restaurant-puzzle

This project is meant to solve a little word scramble puzzle. The puzzle gives a list of words, which should be reordered such that they sound like some other coherent collection of words. For example, "TAB ESS MEANT LISH" might be rearranged to sound like "ESTABLISHMENT." Due to the strict adherence to the phoneme dictionary, however..the program won't currently make that link.

## Usage

Currently just looks for one line of clue words in `resources/clue_words.txt`, the phoneme dictionary in `resources/cmudict-0.7b`, and spits out the answers into `resources/answers.txt`.
